- double based rendering cuz float floating point is bad
	- like make all rendering methods we make take in doubles and then turn into floats if needed so there's no reason people should do what create did for their rendering
- dynamic coordinate storage system?
- actually separated fluid and block system?
- multiparts/subblocks?
- built in support for having shit like immersive portals actually work "perfectly" 
	- this a bit of a long shot but like immersive portals for any portals we make would be lit af
- unified armor/accessories/whatever the fuck else
- gravity system that supports any direction?
- generalize way more stuff then minecraft does
	- a lot of player specific stuff in minecraft doesnt need to be and why the fuck should it be
- make models like actually use class hierarchy
	- why the fuck does like every entity in minecraft have its own sepperate head field istg
- make every entity able to be controlled by a player so like morph mod n stuff is ez
- anti-aliasing
- built in cca type system
